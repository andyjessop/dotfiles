# This folder is added to the $PATH in .bash_profile so
# that the scripts can be run from anywhere. For example,
# if you had a script called `foo` (or `foo.sh`) in this folder,
# you could run it by typing `foo` (or `foo.sh`) in the terminal.
# Ensure, however, that it has executable permissions:
# `chmod +x foo`.
